                    Hello Mr(s). Stranger, my name is Pacelli. Last year around
                    mid-june I got really interested in learning on how
                    blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum works from a coding
                    standpoint. My curiosity lead me to{" "}

                    After a few lessons I began to realize that learning
                    Solidity without any prior knowledge of JavaScript made no
                    sense (at least to me!) so I decided to enroll in The

                    to learn JavaScript. The career path basically consists of
                    modules with screencasts and challenges for you to solve
                    before the answer is presented.

                    Near the end of the career path there was a module
                    consisting of challenges to test everything that I learned
                    of JavaScript on my journey to become a Front-End Developer
                    and after finishing all the challenges I thought it would be
                    cool to build blog-like site with them instead of leaving
                    them in my documents folder taking dust.

                    In general these are small conceptual challenges about
                    different topics and methods of the language and to some
                    I'll present more than one answer.

                    have some fun with these challenges and luckily you will
